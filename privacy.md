# Privacy Policy for InsightFetcher AI

**Last Updated:** August 22, 2025

Thank you for using InsightFetcher AI. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how we handle data when you use our service.

## 1. Data We Process
When you use the InsightFetcher AI GPT to research a URL, we process the following specific pieces of information:
- The **URL** of the web page you provide for analysis.
- The **natural language query** you submit (e.g., "Summarize this article," or "What are the key findings?").

## 2. How We Use Your Data
The data you provide is used solely to perform the core function of the tool:
- Your provided **URL and query** are sent to our secure backend API.
- The API then scrapes the content from the URL and passes that content, along with your query, to a third-party AI model (Groq) to generate a summary or answer.
- The final, AI-generated response is then returned to you through the ChatGPT interface.

## 3. Data Storage and Logging
**We do not store, log, or save any of the URLs you submit, the content scraped from those URLs, or the final summaries you receive.**

All processing is stateless. The data exists only for the time it takes to process your request and is immediately discarded once the operation is complete.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transfer your data. The only external service we interact with is the Groq API, which is essential for the AI-powered summarization functionality of the tool.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
